# DML Hyperparameter Tuning Replication Files
In this Repo we provide the replication code to our simulations as well as the results.

## Data Generating Processes
The data generating processes (dgp) can be found in the `dgp` folder. Note: Due to capacity constrains, we do not provide the `ACIC` datasets. However, the `R` files creating the datasets can be found on the [ACIC 2019 data challenge website]([https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Qqgmb3R9Vt9KTx6t8i_5IbFenylsPfrK/view?usp=sharing](https://sites.google.com/view/acic2019datachallenge/data-challenge)https://sites.google.com/view/acic2019datachallenge/data-challenge).

## Simulation Files
The files for running the simulation study can be found in the `simulations` folder.

## Results
The text files containing the raw results of our simulation runs can be found in the `results` folder.

## Figures and Tables
The notebooks creating the figures and tables from the paper can be found int the `evaluation` folder.
